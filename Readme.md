## About Me
ðŸ‘‹Hey there, I'm Ang Hung Yie, a final-year software engineering student at Taylor's University Malaysia. I'm a data enthusiast passionate about gaining business insight from data and helping businesses make better decisions.

ðŸš€ In this repository, you'll find a collection of projects I've been working on. These projects demonstrate my skills and passion in AI/Ml/DS, and I hope they'll give you a sense of the kind of work I'm capable of.

ðŸ’­Reason why I transitioned from se to DS
I discovered ChatGPT just a day after its launch and was truly impressed by its capabilities. I have come to realise AI is the future game changer, and I'm glad to be the witness!
